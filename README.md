# CongreGate

A repository for a project for GateHacks'2024. This project aims to record and share the amount of students entering and leaving Frank Dining Hall. This would allow students to make informed decisions on when they want to eat at Frank Dining Hall. In the future, this application and hardware can be expanded to also accomodate locations such as the Coop, Huntington gym, and Case-Geyer Library. This program is helpful to students who may want a quieter experience at these locations. 

## Purpose:

Colgate students! Have you ever taken the time to get your friends together to go to Frank Dining Hall only to discover it is far too busy for comfort, with little space to sit or unwind. Have you ever decided to head down to Huntington Gym only to find all the treadmills full or all the workout equipment in use. These are issues that we believe every student has experienced, and we sought to find a solution! We present **CongreGate**, for helping you make informed decisions about when to head out on campus!


CongreGate uses non-invasive sensors to estimate and track the number of people at your favorite locations on campus in real time, allowing you to gauge when is best to get a meal, hit the gym, and more without wasting your time walking to a dining hall only to turn back, or sitting and waiting for gym equipment t be available.

CongreGate is still currently a prototype designed for estimating the capacity of Frank Dining Hall.

## How:

The CongreGate program uses input from two ultrasonic distance sensors to determine whether someone has entered or exited a location. The value of "1" (entered) or "0" (exited) is then transferred via Bluetooth to a laptop where the amount of people in a location is updated. The amount of people present in a location is updated on the table present on the web application as well as the time of the last update. 

## Future Directions:

CongreGate has many opportunities for scaling up, including hardware and software upgrades. For hardware, we could replace the ultrasonic sensors with more accurate hardware, as well as having the hardware present at more locations on campus. For software, we can support more locations, facilities with multiple floors, use long-term data to calculate averages occupancies for each hour and calculate overall peak hours to better inform students, as well as creating a mobile app to make it easier to access.
