# CongreGate
A repository for a project for GateHacks'2024. This project aims to record and share the amount of students entering and leaving Frank Dining Hall. This would allow students to make informed decisions on when they want to eat at Frank Dining Hall. In the future, this application and hardware can be expanded to also accomodate locations such as the Coop, Huntington gym, and Case-Geyer Library. This program is helpful to students who may want a quieter experience at these locations. 

## Purpose:

Colgate students! Have you ever taken the time to get your friends together to go to Frank Dining Hall only to discover it is far too busy for comfort, with little space to sit or unwind. Have you ever decided to head down to Huntington Gym only to find all the treadmills full or all the workout equipment in use. These are issues that we believe every student has experienced, and we sought to find a solution! We present **CongreGate**, for helping you make informed decisions about when to head out on campus!


CongreGate uses non-invasive sensors to estimate and track the number of people at your favorite locations on campus in real time, allowing you to gauge when is best to get a meal, hit the gym, and more without wasting your time walking to a dining hall only to turn back, or sitting and waiting for gym equipment t be available.

CongreGate is still currently a prototype designed for estimating the capacity of Frank Dining Hall.
